# EDDownloader

A quick and dirty console app that downloaded EliteDangerous files from the public server.

## Usage

edd [max downloads] [location path]

If you don't provide _edd_ with either arguments then it will default to 16 concurrent downloads and downloads to a 'download' folder in it's current location.
