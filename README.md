# EDDownloader

A quick and dirty console app that downloaded EliteDangerous files from the public server.

## Usage

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/IainMNorman/EDDownloader/releases/download/0.2/edd.alpha.0.2.zip), unzip and double click edd.exe to run.

You can also pass arguments if you run from the commandline or create a shortcut.

edd [max downloads] [location path]

If you don't provide _edd_ with either arguments then it will default to 16 concurrent downloads and downloads to a 'download' folder in it's current location.
